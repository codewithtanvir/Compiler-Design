## Lab Task-1: Date: 22-Oct-2025
    1.	Write a program to determine whether the Given Input is Numeric Constant or Not. 
    e.g. (if 100, 991, 1810 etc are given as an input , then the program says “numeric constant”, or if we take input as “ABCD”, “A1B2”, then the program will say that this is “not numeric”).

    2.	Write a program to determine whether the Given Input is Operators or Not. (Arithmetic Operators +, -, *, /, %, =)
    e.g., 2+3=5
    Ans: 
    operator1:  + 
    operator2:  = 
    3.	Write a program to determine whether the Given Input is Comment line(s) or Not.

   4. Write a program to determine whether the Given Input is Identifier or Not. []
    Conditions/convention to detect identifier:
    -The first character should be alphabet characters/underscore (A-Z, a-z, _)
    -From the Second character should be alpha-numeric characters/underscore (A-Z, a-z, _ , 0-9)

   5. Find the average value of the elements of an array.
   6. Find the minimum and maximum value of the elements of an array.
   7. Take two strings as your first and last name, then concatenate the two strings together so that you can find your full name:
    e.g. First name = “XX” and Lastname = “YY”
    output: full name = “XX YY”
